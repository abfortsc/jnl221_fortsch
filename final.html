			<h4> The PEN American Index of School Book Bans reveals critical informaion about the status of book bans across the country </h4>
		<h2>Reporting by Amelia Fortsch</h2>
	</section>
		<section>
			<p>
				The state of Florida recorded roughly 1,400 book bans during the 2022-2023 school year, according to the PEN America Index of School Book Bans. That is over double the number of recorded book bans in Texas, the state with the second-highest number of book bans. 
			</p>
			<h3>How the Index Works</h3>
			<p><a href="https://pen.org//" target="_blank">PEN America</a> is a non-profit organization that promotes freedom of expression. Since the fall of 2021, PEN has been using school board meeting minutes, local news stories, and reports from partner organizations to compile indexes of book bans by school year across the country. </p>
			<p> Madison Markham, a co-author of the 2023-2024 index, describes the process of compiling the data. Markham and her colleagues rely on Google alerts and reports from grassroots organizations to alert them of a recent ban. Then, they seek out public reporting or public records to verify if a book was removed from shelves. From there, they confirm the title and author and add it to the index which is then reviewed by the entire team before publishing. Some removals may go unreported because there are no public records or reports of a ban. </p>
			<p>The organization publishes companion pieces with each index that highlight trends in the data. Information such as the reason for the ban is not included in the public version of the index which makes it difficult for outsiders to verify the information or draw their own conclusions. </p>
			<p>PEN <a href="https://pen.org/book-bans-frequently-asked-questions/" target="_blank">defines a school book ban</a>, “as any action taken against a book based on its content and as a result of parent or community challenges, administrative decisions, or in response to direct or threatened action by lawmakers or other governmental officials, that leads to a previously accessible book being either completely removed from availability to students, or where access to a book is restricted or diminished.” Using this definition, the <a href=" https://pen.org/book-bans/2023-banned-book-list/" target="_blank">2022-2023 Index </a> details 3,361 instances of book bans across 33 states.

			<h3>How Books Are Banned</h3>
			<p>Books were banned through formal challenges 30% of the time, meaning a challenge to the book was made through the district’s official process by an individual. </p>
			<p>The second most common origin of a challenge was through an administration challenge with 30%. An administration challenge is when a decision made by a member of a school's administration or a district school board results in the removal or restriction of a book. </p>
			<p>Books banned through informal challenges make up 16% of the book bans. Informal challenges are challenges that do not follow policies as defined by the district. </p>
			<p>In the 2022-2023 school year, 12% of books were banned through legislative action. Legislative action means that books were banned in connection with political pressure from appointed or elected officials or state legislation. Legislative action also includes situations where existing state laws or guidelines are used as a justification for a book ban. </p>
			<p>Although legislative action is only responsible for 12% of book bans, it is one of the most publicized. A popular example is <a href="https://lawlibguides.sandiego.edu/c.php?g=1421168&p=10542274" target="_blank">Florida's "Parental Rights in Education" Bill</a>, commonly known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill.  This bill prohibits classroom discussions from kindergarten to third grade on sexual orientation or gender identity. Passed in March 2022, it allows any parent or resident to object to materials or books used in the classroom that they find inappropriate or not suitable for students. </p>

			<h3>Looking Deeper into Book Ban Data </h3>
			<p>While Ellen Hopkins and Sarah J. Mass had the most bans placed on their books, the index includes 988 unique authors who faced book bans. Books by female authors were twice as likely to be banned than books by male authors. </p>
			<p><a href="https://pen.org/report/book-bans-pressure-to-censor/#heading-11" target="_blank"> The most banned book</a> for this dataset was <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Tricks/Ellen-Hopkins/9781481498241" target="_blank"> <i>Tricks</i> </a> by Ellen Hopkins. Tricks is a Young-Adult novel that details the experience of five high school students who become prostitutes. The second most banned book was <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Bluest-Eye#ref344291" target="_blank"> <i>The Bluest Eye</i></a> by Toni Morrison. The Bluest Eye, an American classic, tells the story of Pecola, a young black girl living in Ohio following the Great Depression. </p>
			<p>The dataset from PEN America does not detail each reason for book bans, but the companion report, <a href="https://pen.org/report/book-bans-pressure-to-censor/#heading-11" target="_blank"> Banned in the USA: The Mounting Pressure to Censor</a>, sheds light on popular reasoning for book bans. </p>
			<p>“One of the other most commonly banned titles which we see increasing are books that feature anything related to sex, or interpreted as sex,” said Markham. </p>
			<p>Along with depictions of sexual experiences, books that include themes of violence or physical abuse are most commonly banned according to the report. These bans also disproportionately affect books that feature the experiences of marginalized groups such as characters of color or characters with  LGBTQ+ identities.</p>

			<h3>Why Track Bans</h3>
			<p>	“I think we've really helped shift public understanding of how much of a crisis this is, particularly in the last like year and a half,” said Markham.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/16/books/book-bans-public-schools.html" target="_blank"> Censorship and book restriction efforts</a> have only become more organized since their inception. The rise of conservative groups, such as Moms for Liberty, indicates that the issue has also become increasingly political. While PEN has tracked instances of book bans across Democratic- and Republican-majority districts, these bans have largely been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/book-bans-censorship-lgbtq-gender-race-libraries-d52fee70d8e3d4f158068de37ce8194b" target="_blank">Republican- or conservative-led.</a></p>
			<p>In <a href="https://apnews.com/article/book-bans-censorship-lgbtq-gender-race-libraries-d52fee70d8e3d4f158068de37ce8194b" target="_blank">Bloomington, Minnesota</a>, a petition was created by a conservative group to ban 29 books that contained what they deemed sexually explicit. Lawmakers and citizens fought back and the Minnesota Senate passed a proposal in April 2024 that prohibits book bans based on content or ideological objections. Other Democratic-leaning states such as California, Connecticut, Delaware, and New York are looking to enact similar prohibitions on book banning. </p>

			<h3>Potential Rise in Statewide Book Bans</h3>
			<p>“We expect, unfortunately, that book bans are going to be harder to track because we're seeing laws that ban books statewide, which is relatively new,” said Markham. </p>
			<p>In Utah, these <a href="https://apnews.com/article/utah-school-book-ban-d7345be6a89cfa6cd2cb5ddd25fca700" target="_blank">statewide book bans</a> are already taking place. Thirteen books have been banned under a new law that requires all public schools in the state to remove a book if it is banned in three or more districts.  </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>The Future of Books Bans</h3>
			<p>Ultimately, the future of book bans is uncertain. With legislation coming from both sides of the aisle, it is unclear how things will pan out. Organizations like PEN America will continue to track these book bans across the country as best as they can, but the effectiveness of their efforts will be hard to predict as laws surrounding book bans evolve. </p>
			<p>“What we have access to in libraries as kids really matters,” said Markham. “Young people deserve that because eventually, they're going to enter the real world. And whether we control, whether we restrict their access to books or not does not change the fact that those things exist in the real world, I mean, except for a fantasy novel with unicorns, but the themes in the fantasy novel are still applicable.” </p>
